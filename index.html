    <h1>Java Basic Interview Questions</h1>
    
    <div class="question">Q1. What is Java?</div>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a widely used language for developing applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q2. What are the features of Java?</div>
    <p>Key features of Java include platform independence, object-orientation, security, robustness, simplicity, multithreading support, and garbage collection.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q3. What is JVM and why is it important?</div>
    <p>JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is the part of the Java Run-time Environment that executes Java byte code. It is important because it provides a platform-independent way of executing Java code.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q4. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</div>
    <p>JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full software development kit required to develop Java applications, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a subset of JDK that is required to run Java applications, and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the component of JRE that executes Java bytecode.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q5. What is the use of the public static void main(String[] args) method?</div>
    <p>This method is the entry point for any Java application. It is the method called by the JVM to run the program.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q6. Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.</div>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). Java uses OOP principles including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q7. What is inheritance in Java?</div>
    <p>Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept where one class can inherit fields and methods from another class. In Java, inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q8. What is polymorphism in Java?</div>
    <p>Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q9. Explain encapsulation with an example in Java.</div>
    <p>Encapsulation in Java is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is usually done by making fields private and providing public getter and setter methods.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q10. What is an interface in Java?</div>
    <p>An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q11. Explain the concept of an abstract class.</div>
    <p>An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods, which do not have an implementation and must be implemented in subclasses.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q12. What are constructors in Java?</div>
    <p>Constructors in Java are special methods used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created and has the same name as the class.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q13. What is method overloading?</div>
    <p>Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their parameter lists are different. It is a way of implementing compile-time polymorphism.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q14. What is method overriding?</div>
    <p>Method overriding, in Java, is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q15. What is a package in Java?</div>
    <p>In Java, a package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually, packages are similar to different folders on your computer.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q16. Explain the final keyword in Java.</div>
    <p>The final keyword in Java can be used to mark a variable as constant (not changeable), a method as not overrideable, or a class as not inheritable.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q17. What are Java Exceptions?</div>
    <p>Exceptions in Java are events that disrupt the normal flow of the program. They are objects that wrap an error event that occurred within a method and are either caught or propagated further up the calling chain.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q18. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?</div>
    <p>Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time, meaning that the code must handle or declare them. Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime, meaning they can be thrown without being caught or declared.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q19. What is the static keyword used for in Java?</div>
    <p>The static keyword in Java is used to indicate that a particular field, method, or block of code belongs to the class, rather than instances of the class. Static members are shared among all instances of a class.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q30. Explain volatile keyword in Java.</div>
    <p>The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. Declaring a variable volatile ensures that its value is read from the main memory and not from the thread's cache memory.</p>
