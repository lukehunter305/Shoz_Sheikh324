    <div class="question">Q1. What is Java?</div>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a widely used language for developing applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q2. What are the features of Java?</div>
    <p>Key features of Java include platform independence, object-orientation, security, robustness, simplicity, multithreading support, and garbage collection.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q3. What is JVM and why is it important?</div>
    <p>JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is the part of the Java Runtime Environment that executes Java byte code. It is important because it provides a platform-independent way of executing Java code.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q4. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</div>
    <p>JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full software development kit required to develop Java applications, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a subset of JDK that is required to run Java applications, and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the component of JRE that executes Java bytecode.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q5. What is the use of the public static void main(String[] args) method?</div>
    <p>This method is the entry point for any Java application. It is the method called by the JVM to run the program.</p>
