    <div class="question">Q1. What is Java?</div>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a widely used language for developing applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q2. What are the features of Java?</div>
    <p>Key features of Java include platform independence, object-orientation, security, robustness, simplicity, multithreading support, and garbage collection.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q3. What is JVM and why is it important?</div>
    <p>JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is the part of the Java Runtime Environment that executes Java byte code. It is important because it provides a platform-independent way of executing Java code.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q4. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</div>
    <p>JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full software development kit required to develop Java applications, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a subset of JDK that is required to run Java applications, and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the component of JRE that executes Java bytecode.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q5. What is the use of the public static void main(String[] args) method?</div>
    <p>This method is the entry point for any Java application. It is the method called by the JVM to run the program.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q6. Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.</div>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). Java uses OOP principles including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q7. What is inheritance in Java?</div>
    <p>Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept where one class can inherit fields and methods from another class. In Java, inheritance is achieved using the <code>extends</code> keyword.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q8. What is polymorphism in Java?</div>
    <p>Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading.</p>
    
    <div class="question">Q9. Explain encapsulation with an example in Java.</div>
    <p>Encapsulation in Java is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. Example:</p>
    <pre>
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String newName) { this.name = newName; }
}
    </pre>
    
    <div class="question">Q10. What is an interface in Java?</div>
    <p>An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default.</p>
